Installation
------------
Copy the file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncbi/vadr/master/vadr-install.sh
to a new empty directory where you want to install VADR.

If you are installing on a Linux system, execute the command:

sh ./vadr-install.sh linux

If you are installing on a Mac/OSX silicon (M1/M2) system, execute the
command:

sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-silicon

If you are installing on a Mac/OSX intel system, execute the command:

sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-intel

Next, set your environment variables as explained at the end of the
output of the above command.

Finally, run tests to verify that your installation was successful by
running the command:

$VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/do-install-tests-local.sh

---

Alternative two-step installation: 

It may be more convenient for some users to perform two separate steps
to first download the necessary files and then build them. To do that,
replace the single 'sh ./vadr-install.sh' command recommended above
with two commands, as follows:

If you are installing on a Linux system, execute the commands:

sh ./vadr-install.sh linux download
sh ./vadr-install.sh linux build

If you are installing on a Mac/OSX silicon (M1/M2) system, execute the
commands:

sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-silicon download
sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-silicon build

If you are installing on a Mac/OSX intel system, execute the commands:

sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-intel download
sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx-intel build

These two commands must be run from the same directory.

Then proceed with setting the environment variables as explained at
the end of the second vadr-install.sh command above, and with running
tests as explained above.
