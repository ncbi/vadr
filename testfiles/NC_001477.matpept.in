# This file explains how CDS and mat_peptide annotation for NC_001477
# are related.
#
# Format of lines in this file:
# <CDS-idx> <'primary' OR 'all'> <mat_peptide-1-idx>:<mat_peptide-2-idx>:<mat_peptide-n-idx>
# 'primary' lines: these define the 'primary' peptides in order, the
#                  CDS <CDS-idx> is comprised of the peptides listed
#                  in final token, which are contiguous, start of 
#                  first mat_peptide to stop of final mat_peptide is
#                  one contiguous subsequence.
#
# 'all' lines:     these define all the peptides that are ultimately
#                  derived from CDS <CDS-idx>. It will be a superset
#                  of the primary line for this index but will
#                  additionally include mat_peptides that are
#                  secondarily cleaved from the primary mat_peptides.
