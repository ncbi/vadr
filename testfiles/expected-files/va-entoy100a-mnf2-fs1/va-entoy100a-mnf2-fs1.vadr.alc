1     nmiscftr  yes      TOO_MANY_MISC_FEATURES         sequence     12    12  too many features are reported as misc_features
2     mutstart  yes*     MUTATION_AT_START               feature      3     3  expected start codon could not be identified
3     mutendns  yes*     MUTATION_AT_END                 feature      2     2  expected stop codon could not be identified, no in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted start codon
4     unexleng  yes*     UNEXPECTED_LENGTH               feature      8     4  length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3
5     cdsstopn  yes*     CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON              feature      6     6  in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference
6     fsthicft  yes*     POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT_HIGH_CONF   feature      4     4  high confidence possible frameshift in CDS (frame not restored before end)
7     fsthicfi  yes*     POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT_HIGH_CONF   feature      8     8  high confidence possible frameshift in CDS (frame restored before end)
8     peptrans  yes*     PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM     feature     24    12  mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
9     indf3gap  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END       feature      4     2  alignment to homology model is a gap at 3' boundary
10    indf3lcn  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END       feature      4     4  alignment to homology model has low confidence at 3' boundary for feature that does not match a CDS
